### Project Summary
In this project, [Sean Lahman’s Baseball Database](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/ "Sean Lahman’s Baseball Database") is analyzed for the years between 2008 and 2016. The project is consisted of 3 web pages that includes 3 visualizations. 

The graph on the first page shows the number of players from each country filtered by the team over the period of the data (based on their debut). 

The visualization in the second web page shows the average salary per MLB team over the selected time frame. The graph allows users to filter the data by year.  

The third graph shows filtered data by a player of that player’s salary over the years of the data set with an additional side box with player information and statistics.

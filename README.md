### Project Summary
In this project, [Sean Lahman’s Baseball Database](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/ "Sean Lahman’s Baseball Database") is analyzed.  

We narrowed our focus to the following:
Player info – over 19,500 records – list of players with an MLB debut date from 1871 to 2018.

Teams – approximately 2,900 records – detailed information about each MLB team’s performance, including number of wins and runs scored per season, from 1871 to 2018.

Salaries – approximately 26,500 records – individual player salary by year and team from 1985 to 2016

The project is consisted of 3 web pages that includes 3 visualizations. 

The graph on the "player" page shows average salary of a player over the years with an additional info below the chart with player information and statistics. The visualization in the "salary" page shows the average salary per player in MLB teams for the selected year. The graph allows users to filter the data by year. The third graph at "wins" page shows wins and runs for a team per year.
